The `develop` branch of the [MODFLOW 6 repository](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6) contains bug fixes and new functionality that may be incorporated into the next [approved MODFLOW 6 release](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model). Minimal development distributions are posted regularly to [nightly build repository](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest) &mdash; these should be considered preliminary, provisional release candidates for the next version of MODFLOW 6.

## Distribution contents

The nightly builds are available as operating-system specific [distributions](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest) including binaries, MODFLOW 6 input/output documentation, development notes, and a `code.json` metadata file. 

### Binaries

The binaries are built in develop mode.

Linux binaries built on Ubuntu 22.04 may encounter `libc`-related backwards-incompatibilities on earlier versions of Ubuntu or other Linux distributions. This distribution, the main MODFLOW 6 distribution, and the [`MODFLOW-USGS/executables`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases) distribution are built on Ubuntu 20.04 for broader compatibility.

### Documentation

Release notes summarizing the current development cycle's changeset are included in the nightly distribution. The distribution also includes a copy of the *'MODFLOW 6 – Description of Input and Output'* document (`mf6io.pdf`).

## Tags

Release tags are based on the date, with format `YYYYMMDD`. Nightly builds are retained for 30 days in the event that there are issues with the latest release candidate. 

## Reporting issues

Any issues with the nightly build should be posted on the main [MODFLOW 6 GitHub repo](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6) and flagged with the [nightly build](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6/labels/nightly%20build) label.
